        My personal interest include hair and anything based on cosmetology. I also love fashion. If I decide to go to college, 
        I would most likely major in real estate or dentistry. To dig a little deeper, I would prefer to be an orthodontist. 
        With real estate, I'm not quite sure due to the fact that I've heard it's not as easy as it looks. It could take years 
        for your career to actually take off and for you to close on homes.
